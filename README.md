# maze-madness

A small project completed by myself and several other counselors working at Emagination Tech Camp Georgia 2019.
The basis of the game is simple, navigate the maze and find the 3 keys to complete the game. However, the challenge is that every 30 seconds, the layout of the maze changes, so you must find the correct path to the key before it swaps and you possibly lose all your progress.
